# DFA-attack-on-AES

This project deals with imposing differential fault analysis attack on aes algorithm by injecting only two faults and extracting the aes key.

# Requirements

Python 27

# Usage

" python aes.py " for encryption<br>
" python inject_fault.py " for fault injection<br>
" python extract_key.py " for extracting the aes key
